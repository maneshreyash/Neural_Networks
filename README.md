# Implementation of Neural Networks algorithm

* Choose a dataset from the UCI repositories.
* Preprocess the data to be able to fit into a Neural Network algorithm.
* Implement the algorithm of Neural Network and improve the accuracy by variation of parameters like; the number of hidden layers, the number of neurons in each of the hidden layer.

You can make the following assumptions and simplifications for this program:
* You can ignore the bias neurons
* You can assume that the last column will be the class label column
* You can assume that the training and test datasets will have the same format i.e. same number and placement of columns
* You donâ€™t need to implement regularization, adaptive learning rate, or momentum factors.
